                    Confidentiality of your research records will be strictly maintained. We assign code numbers to each participant so that data is never directly linked to individual identity, and we are interested in group results rather than the responses of particular individuals. Any emails will never be shared with anyone nor linked to your data.  Data are kept in our laboratory and are only viewed by the investigators. These data files are kept on our computer indefinitely.

                <li>
                    Taking part in this study is voluntary. Not taking part or withdrawing after the study has begun will result in no loss of services from NYU to which you are otherwise entitled. You have the right to skip or not answer any questions you prefer not to answer.
